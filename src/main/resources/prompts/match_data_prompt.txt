[CRITICAL OUTPUT RULE: Return EXACTLY 10 player objects (5 per team) in the 'players' array.
The LANE RULE MUST be met (TOP, JUNGLE, MID, ADC, SUPPORT must be unique per team). Use ONLY these five standard codes for laneName.]

This is a League of Legends match result screen.
Analyze the image to determine the winner (BLUE/RED), the game duration, and all player stats.
Winning Side: Check 'Victory'/'Defeat' text and background colors. If text is missing, set analysisStatus to FAILURE_NO_VICTORY_TEXT.
Otherwise, set to SUCCESS and determine finalWinnerTeam (BLUE or RED) and team1Side (BLUE or RED).
Duration: Find the Total Game Duration (format Xm Ys) and convert it to total seconds (e.g., 25m 30s -> 1530).
Stats: Extract stats for all 10 players. Note the positions: 'totalDamage' is the second column from the right (often marked with a star *).
'totalGold' is the final column on the far right. Extract 'gameName', 'tagLine', 'team' (RED/BLUE), 'championName', 'kills', 'deaths', 'assists', 'totalGold' (far right column), and 'totalDamage' (second from right).
-- 1. CHAMPION NAME DEDUCTION --
The 'championName' is located directly beneath the player's Riot ID (gameName).
You MUST prioritize the text in this specific position to determine the champion.
Use the provided Champion List [%s] to correct any slight OCR errors and map the text to the closest valid champion name.
CHAMPION VISUAL CONFIRMATION: Before finalizing the 'championName', cross-check the detected name against the visual representation (the champion's portrait/icon in the image) to ensure consistency.
Prioritize the visual context if the text is ambiguous.
Specific OCR Correction: If you detect any confusion between the letter 'O' and the number '0', or between the letter 'I' and '1', always assume the letter variant unless the surrounding context is strictly numerical.
Correct all player names accordingly.
FINAL NAME VALIDATION: The output 'championName' for each player MUST be an exact match to one of the names in the champion list [%s].
-- 2. LANE DEDUCTION PRIORITY --
Use the visual references provided via URL, the champion's meta-role, AND the preferred roles hint to uniquely assign lanes (TOP, JUNGLE, MID, ADC, SUPPORT) to all 5 players per team.
JUNGLE PRIORITY: The MOST RELIABLE indicator for 'JUNGLE' is the 'Smite' summoner spell.
**JUNGLE DEDUCTION: The Smite spell icon is located in one of the two Summoner Spell slots next to the champion portrait.
Use the provided Smite Icon URL [%s] as a reference image to accurately confirm the Smite spell is present and assign 'JUNGLE'.**
If a player has a Smite spell, assign 'JUNGLE'.
SUPPORT PRIORITY: The MOST RELIABLE indicator for 'SUPPORT' is a 'Support Item' in their starting item slot.
**SUPPORT DEDUCTION: The Support Item is located in the first (leftmost) item slot in the row of item slots next to the Summoner Spells.
Use the provided Support Item URLs [%s] as reference images to confirm a support item is present and assign 'SUPPORT'.**
If a player has a Support Item, assign 'SUPPORT'.
-- ADDITIONAL HINT: Player Data --

RIOT ID HINT: Use the registered accounts list [%s] to correct any OCR errors and accurately map the Riot IDs (gameName).
PREFERRED LANE HINT: You are provided with a list of known players and their preferred roles in the format [GameName#TagLine:PREF_LANE]: [%s].
PRIORITY: After checking JUNGLE and SUPPORT visual indicators, use this preferred roles list as a strong tie-breaker when deducing TOP, MID, or ADC for ambiguous cases.
Crucially, ensure the LANE RULE is met (5 unique roles per team).
-- CRITICAL STRUCTURAL RULE (Overrides OCR Failures) --
If a player's stats cannot be clearly OCR'd, use zero/best judgment to maintain the 10-player structure.
