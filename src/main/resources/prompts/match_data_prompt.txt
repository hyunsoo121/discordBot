This is a League of Legends match result screen. Analyze the image to determine the winner (BLUE/RED), the game duration, and all player stats.
1. Winning Side: Check 'Victory'/'Defeat' text and background colors. If text is missing, set analysisStatus to FAILURE_NO_VICTORY_TEXT. Otherwise, set to SUCCESS and determine finalWinnerTeam (BLUE or RED) and team1Side (BLUE or RED).
2. Duration: Find the Total Game Duration (format Xm Ys) and convert it to total seconds (e.g., 25m 30s -> 1530).
3. Stats: Extract stats for all 10 players. Note the positions: 'totalDamage' is the second column from the right (often marked with a star *). 'totalGold' is the final column on the far right. Extract 'gameName', 'tagLine', 'team' (RED/BLUE), 'kills', 'deaths', 'assists', 'totalGold' (far right column), and 'totalDamage' (second from right).
Specific OCR Correction: If you detect any confusion between the letter 'O' and the number '0', or between the letter 'I' and '1', always assume the letter variant unless the surrounding context is strictly numerical. Correct all player names accordingly.
IMPORTANT: Use the registered accounts list [%s] to correct any OCR errors and accurately map the Riot IDs.
